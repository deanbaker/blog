> Podcast with Brett Willemsen - Head of Engineering   Management @ HotDoc | Dean Baker - Head of Engineering @ Realtair | Jason DeVincentes - Head of Technology @ AttackForge

My first time on a podcast, I had a great time with the guys discussing some of the ins and outs of building high performance teams. A lot of good and contrasting ideas in this one, I hope to do more of this!
