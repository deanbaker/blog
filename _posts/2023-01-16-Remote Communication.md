> Resetting my communication ways of working in 2023


I have mixed feelings about being 100% remote (Realtair is 100% remote, and I do miss the office environment from time to time). I read a lot about structuring work and communication in a remote environment and have had some success in changing behaviour. 

I feel I could have been much better at moving us towards a more asynchronous communication style to avoid some pain points I observed: 
- So many video calls
- So many video calls without agendas
- Me asking for people to turn their cameras on
- Asking questions to people and getting a "please repeat the question" aka "I wasn't listening."

> It was painful. 

Not to mention the struggle of finding appropriate meeting times across multiple time zones - almost impossible at times!

So, a reset for 2023.

Today I stumbled upon a video that shares some insight into working remotely, which goes against many of my current ways of working (like using Slack for all things). Nevertheless, there are some excellent points, some I agree with, and some I don't.

# Key Takeaways
- Working in a distributed team means working asynchronously.
- A distributed team is a professional group whose members do not rely on proximity in order to routinely collaborate productively
- Being productive in a distributed team is a skill that most people must learn; it is not innate to us.
- Nothing has as dire impact an on productivity as poor communications
- A capable distributed team habitually externalises information ← this is a big one.

For me, one of my biggest challenges is that last point. Encouraging the team to be as transparent as possible to encourage open and honest collaboration can be hard when we are locked up in private channels and DMs in Slack. 

## Modes of communication
Florian outlines  five major modes of communication in teams and talks about their pros and cons:

The wiki, and the Issue Tracker - basically Atlassian are the clear winners for Florian. Email and chat are on the same par for different reasons, and video chat is the clear loser here.

After listening to the talk and reflecting on my experience, I see where he is going. I have also used the wiki much more since going remote. I have also used Slack much, much more - and I realise how hard it has been for me to search for details and try to correlate messages between channels and DMs. 

I won't go into too much more detail on his talk, I just won't do it justice. Here are some points that really got me thinking

## Thinking Slides
![Chat is lazy](/assets/images/remote%20communication/chat%20is%20lazy.png)
Originally I thought chat was a good tool for asynchronous work (maybe I still do). But Florian makes some good points about it essentially being synchronous. At best, we are waiting for responses, at its worst, we are continually disrupting deep work by constantly distracting and breaking others' concentration.

![Video Calls](/assets/images/remote%20communication/video_calls.png)
Anyone who has been on a video call with me would not be surprised when I ask for the camera to be turned on. Florian knows what he wants, and what he wants out of a video meeting is to pick up on contextual and nonverbal cues.

![Video Call Agenda](/assets/images/remote%20communication/video_call_agenda.png)
I have written about this before. If you are going to take the time away from people to join your meeting, you had better be framing it correctly. Give them a chance to prepare, research, and know what they are in for. Without an agenda, we won’t know if the meeting has achieved its goals.

![Summarise Meeting](/assets/images/remote%20communication/summarise_meeting.jpg)
I struggle to do this effectively, and I need to get better. If we do have a meeting, we need to be able to externalise the content. What was discussed, what actions were there, who is driving what? Often you end up with a wiki anyway - can we just collaborate on there and have a 15min wrapup?

Florian writes 
> Once you do meetings right, you no longer need most of them.

---

![Are there any questions](/assets/images/remote%20communication/are_there_any_questions.jpg)
Another skill for me to get better at. Stop asking this question and start giving people deadlines. Some folks don't want to voice questions on a public call or slack channel in real-time. Give some time and space to think and respond appropriately.
