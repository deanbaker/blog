> Modernising development using API First & Lessons Learned

My first time presenting at a conference was during a global pandemic. For [Shane Lee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shane-lee-69114326/) and I, presenting was running a slide deck from our respective home offices. 

It was still a fantastic first experience, and I hope to present again, but in person soon, there was a lot to learn from it.
