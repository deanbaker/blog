> My first podcast experience

My first time on a podcast, I had a great time with the guys discussing some of the ins and outs of building high-performance teams. A lot of good and contrasting ideas in this one, I hope to do more of this!

Shout out to [Brett Willemsen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bzmw/) - Head of Engineering Management @ HotDoc & [Jason DeVincentes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-de-vincentis-93246113/) - Head of Technology @ AttackForge for the great conversation.
