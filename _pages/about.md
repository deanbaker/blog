I am a technology leader, passionate about building teams and setting them up for success. I am still hands-on from time to time and will start using this space for my content as I move away from medium.com.

Currently working as Head of Engineering for a scale-up in Australia, I focus on our engineering roadmap, architecture and ways of working. Learning and development are core to what I do. Where I am able, I will try to open doors to my staff inside and outside the organisation; L&D is the best way to build an effective team and is a mindset I strive to instil into my team.
